COMMENT = 'Semantic view for revenue, accounts receivable, and invoice reconciliation in the finance chatbot POC'
AI_SQL_GENERATION 'Use customer-level finance definitions consistently. Open amount means invoice amount minus posted payments. Total revenue refers to recognized revenue from CUSTOMER_REVENUE_MTH_V, not invoice amount. Overdue means open amount is greater than zero and due date is before the current date. For mismatch questions, use INVOICE_RECON_V and explain which field differs.'
AI_QUESTION_CATEGORIZATION 'Questions about revenue, monthly revenue, customer revenue, open balances, overdue invoices, AR aging, and invoice mismatches are in scope. If a question asks for invoice document text or supporting invoice passages, that should be answered by Cortex Search instead of this semantic view.'
